# Machine Learning Project
Project in Machine Learning course of the Master in Data Science with specialization in Business Analytics at NOVA IMS.

This project was based in a Kaggle competition which the main goal was to predict if the citizen has an income above the average or not. In this classification problem we applied several classifiers as Neural Networks or Decision trees as well as some ensembles classifiers as AdaBoost or Gradient Boosting. in the end, after evaluating the different models <<< a Gradient Boosting classifier to make the predictions.
